## MFF Assignements for Programming I Course in Python

This is a selected compilation of solved assignements from Programming I course on Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, UK.
The assignements are in chronological order, as they were given to us. Therefore, easier exercises can be expected to have lower numbers.
There were tests for each exercises, and my solutions have not always passed all tests. My success rate was 80% on average.
The instructions for each exercise are written in code, above the solution.


This course introduced me to the basics of Python programming, but more importantly to algorithms:
- sorting algorithms (insert sort, selection sort, heap sort, merge sort) 
- graph traversal (BFS, DFS)
- binary trees
- minheap and maxheap
- linked lists
- stacks and queues
